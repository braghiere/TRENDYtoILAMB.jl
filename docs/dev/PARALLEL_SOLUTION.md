# Parallel Conversion Solution

## Overview
Successfully implemented **manual parallel conversion** using 6 independent Julia processes to leverage multi-core system (96 cores available).

## Performance
- **Sequential**: ~4.2 files/hour = ~7 days for 840 files  
- **Manual Parallel (6 groups)**: ~6× speedup = **~20-24 hours** for remaining files
- **Distributed (tested)**: 250× speedup on small subset but failed to scale to production

## Solution: Manual Parallel Approach

### Why This Works
1. ✅ **No NetCDF thread-safety issues** - Each process has its own file handles
2. ✅ **No distributed computing complexity** - No package loading overhead on workers
3. ✅ **Independent processes** - One failure doesn't stop others
4. ✅ **Simple monitoring** - Standard log files and process management
5. ✅ **Proven reliable** - Based on the working sequential code

### Architecture
```
launch_all_groups.sh
├── Group 1 (48 files) → group_1.log
├── Group 2 (41 files) → group_2.log
├── Group 3 (50 files) → group_3.log
├── Group 4 (49 files) → group_4.log
├── Group 5 (35 files) → group_5.log
└── Group 6 (35 files) → group_6.log
```

## Usage

### Generate Group Scripts
```bash
cd /home/renatob/TRENDYtoILAMB.jl
julia --project=. examples/convert_parallel_manual.jl
```

This creates:
- `/home/renatob/convert_group_*.jl` - Individual conversion scripts (6 groups)
- `/home/renatob/launch_all_groups.sh` - Master launcher script

### Launch Conversion
```bash
/home/renatob/launch_all_groups.sh
```

### Monitor Progress
```bash
# Simple file count
find /home/renatob/data/ilamb_ready -name "*.nc" | wc -l

# Full monitoring dashboard
/home/renatob/monitor_manual.sh

# Check individual group logs
tail -f /home/renatob/group_*.log
```

### Check Active Processes
```bash
ps aux | grep convert_group | grep -v grep
```

## Implementation Details

### File Distribution
Files are split by **model** across 6 groups to ensure:
- Even distribution of workload
- Files from same model processed by same group (simpler)
- No file conflicts (each output file written by exactly one process)

### Memory Management
Each group includes:
- `GC.gc()` after every file conversion
- `GC.gc(true)` every 10 files for aggressive cleanup
- Typical memory usage: 0.3-0.5 GB per process (~2-3 GB total)

### Error Handling
- Each file wrapped in try-catch
- Errors logged but don't stop group
- Counters track successes and failures per group

## Status (Oct 20, 2025)

### Completed
- ✅ Groups 1, 2, 3, 6: Successfully completed
- ✅ Groups 4, 5: Relaunched with fixed variable scoping
- ✅ 162 files converted so far (target: ~364 total)

### Files Remaining
- ~202 files remaining (as of last check)
- Estimated completion: **~12-18 hours** from restart

## Alternatives Explored

### 1. Multi-Threading ❌
**Problem**: NetCDF/HDF5 libraries are not thread-safe
- Causes segmentation faults
- Cannot be used regardless of worker count

### 2. Distributed Computing ❌  
**Test Results**: 250× speedup (6 files in 20 seconds)
**Production Reality**: Stalls during package loading
- 24 workers: Stalled at initialization
- 8 workers: Ran for 2+ days with 0 progress
- Root cause: Package loading overhead with many workers

### 3. Manual Parallel ✅
**Current solution** - Works reliably!

## Lessons Learned

1. **Test ≠ Production**: Small-scale distributed tests worked great, production scaled poorly
2. **Simple is Better**: Manual parallel approach more reliable than complex distributed
3. **NetCDF Constraints**: Thread-safety issues eliminated multi-threading entirely
4. **Process Independence**: Independent processes more robust than coordinated workers

## Future Improvements

If needed to speed up further:
1. **Increase groups**: Run 12-16 groups instead of 6 (more parallelism)
2. **Model-level parallelization**: Process different simulations (S0-S3) of same model in parallel
3. **Hybrid approach**: Combine manual parallel with smaller distributed batches
4. **Hardware**: Use faster storage (SSD) or parallel filesystem
